## Jython related projects

### [JyNI](https://jyni.org/)
Aims to enable Jython to use native CPython extensions such as [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) or [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/).

### [The Very Slow Jython Project](https://github.com/jeff5/very-slow-jython)
The aim of the Very Slow Jython project is to re-think implementation choices in the Jython core, through the gradual, narrated evolution of a toy implementation, starting from zero code.
